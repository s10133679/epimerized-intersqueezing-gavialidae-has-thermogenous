 * File must be in the same directory as the project files
 * The first line must consist of two numbers seperated with a comma ( eg. 2,3 ),  The first number is the Xsize of the map, the second is Ysize.
 * X increases on the map from left to right, Y increases on the map going down

    {{{0,0  1,0  2,0}}}

    {{{0,1  1,1  2,1}}}

    {{{0,2  1,2  2,2}}}


 * There must be Ysize number of lines after the first line ( described above )
 * Each one of these lines must consist of Xsize number of numbers, seperated with commas

== How Some Issures Are Dealt With ==
 *If file is not found, an Exception is thrown and the system will exit with exit code -1
 *In the case that the value is not a number, A  NumberFormatException wil be thrown and the system will exit with exit code -1
 *If there are too many X or Y variables in the file they will be ignored
 *If there is not X or Y variables, map will be filled with EMPTY.
